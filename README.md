# Project 13 - Argent Bank

Argent Bank is a web application enabling customers to log in and manage their accounts and profiles.

>Note that if you go to my production version on Github, you won't be able to log in and access the profile page because the backend server isn't running. If you want to access the full version of the site, follow the instructions below.
